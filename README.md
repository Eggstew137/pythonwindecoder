This is windecode!
this is a very experimental project, dont expect good recognition.
Windecode is made to use python to decode the confusing-ass names microsoft names their windows .ISOs
So you dont have to just gues what "GSP1RMCPRXFRER_EN_DVD.ISO" is.
To start decoding a filename just run
```bash
python3 windecode.py "filename.foo"
```
